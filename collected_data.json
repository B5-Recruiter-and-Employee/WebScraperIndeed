Skills & Requirements Types of Roles We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general \"gist\" of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code systems. (1) Client Side - Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on (2) Full Stack Web Services - Full stack developers who working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. (3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast \"good enough\" approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in \"science experiment land\" Requirements: MapLarge to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
